                <p>To achieve a captivating and healthy smile, you sometimes need a tad more care than the standard dental exam, cleaning, and occasional whitening.

                    Dental specialists are oral healthcare providers who receive specialized training after dental school. These professionals are similar to medical doctors who undergo specific or additional training to become, for example, radiologists and plastic surgeons. In this article, we will discuss the different types of dentists you may encounter during a lifetime of oral care.

                <h1>9 Types of Dental Specialists: Get to Know Your Dental Care Team</h1>
                <h2>The Types of Dental Specialists</h2>
                <h3>1. General Dentist</h3>
                <p>As your primary dental care provider, a general dentist has many responsibilities and competencies, including the diagnosis, treatment, care, and management of your overall oral health. Non-metal fillings, periodontal (gum) care, root canal surgeries, crowns, bridges, and preventive education are some of the services a general dentist provides, among several others.</p>

                <h2>2. Periodontist</h2>
                <p>Being a licensed periodontist entails diagnosing, treating, and repressing various diseases that occur in the gums (soft tissues of the mouth), as well as the supporting structures (bones) of the teeth, whether they are natural or manmade teeth.

                    In particular, this dental specialist examines and treats gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) and periodontitis (gum and bone disease). Someone who specializes in periodontics may perform these procedures:</p>

                <h2>3. Endodontist</h2>
                <p>An endodontist has the critical responsibility of diagnosing, treating, and preventing infections and injuries in the human dental pulp or the nerve of the tooth. This dental expert may perform simple to advanced root canal treatments, as well as other types of restorative root procedures.</p>
                <h2>4. Orthodontist</h2>
                <p>This oral health care provider specializes in the diagnosis, interception, and treatment of malocclusions, otherwise known as “bad bites” of the teeth and surrounding structures. Orthodontists can transform an unattractive smile to one that radiates.

                    Malocclusions can result from missing teeth, crowded teeth, excess teeth, or misaligned jaws. An orthodontist’s role is to straighten teeth with the use of specialized bands, wires, and other immovable or detachable corrective appliances like retainers, braces, and Invisalign.</p>
                <h2>5. Prosthodontist</h2>
                <p>A prosthodontist concentrates in the restoration of natural teeth and the replacement of missing teeth on a larger scale than a general dentist. This dental care professional utilizes artificial teeth (dentures) or crowns (caps) as permanent replacements for missing or extracted teeth. Furthermore, some prosthodontists address and rehabilitate deformities of the head and neck, replacing any missing parts of the face and jaw with artificial substitutes.</p>
                <h1>6. Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist</h1>
                <p>An oral and maxillofacial radiologist specializes in taking and interpreting x-ray images and any other data collected in the diagnosis and management of diseases and conditions of the oral and maxillofacial region (face, mouth, and jaws).</p>

                <h1>7. Pediatric Dentist or Pedodontist</h1>
                <p>Being a pedodontist entails diagnosing and treating the dental problems of children. This dentist can identify and address the onset of decay, crowding, crookedness, falling teeth, and other oral health problems. Pediatric dentists encourage parents to schedule their child’s first dental appointment as soon as the first tooth erupts.

                    If you are concerned about a pediatric dentist’s qualifications, know that this professional has at least two additional years of rigorous training beyond dental school. The training focuses on the treatment and management of a child’s developing teeth, their individual behaviors, physical growth and development, and the specific demands of children’s dentistry.</p>
                <h2>9. Dental Hygienist</h2>
                <p>According to the American Dental Hygienists Association (ADHA), a dental hygienist is an oral health professional who holds the responsibility of preventing and treating oral diseases. A dental hygienist cleans teeth, checks the mouth for signs of oral diseases, and performs other preventive dental care. Educating patients on how to improve and maintain good oral health is also an integral part of their job.

                    Regardless of the state in which this professional practices, all dental hygienists must be state licensed. And not to be confused with dental assistants, whose work generally requires the direct supervision of a licensed dentist, dental hygienists perform much of their duties independently.</p>
